A brief description of how this all works.

To set things up:

git clone -b dnsdist-mod2 https://github.com/GlobalCyberAlliance/pdns.git

In the directory tree under the top pdns directory, install this directory, ie. so you have these files in pdns/zzz-gca-example

Compile dnsdist with the libsodium option (needed for protobuf use) by running build-dnsdist2.sh


Make sure you have lua 5.1 installed and cd into the lua-tinycdb-0.2-modified-Makefile directory.
Run make with the specially modified Makefile which uses lua 5.1

Run the test-tinycdb.lua program to verify that lua, tinycdb and the cdb database all work together.

There are also some test scripts for your exploration in the CDB_Database directory which are described in notes-cdb.txt in that directory.

Ready the powerdns generic protobuf server by generating dnsmessage_pb2.py in pdns/contrib/ by following the instructions in the top couple lines of 
pdns/contrib/ProtobufLogger.py:
	run: protoc -I=../pdns/ --python_out=. ../pdns/dnsmessage.proto


Now you should be actually ready to test dnsdist:

1. Open a console in pdns/zzz-gca-example and run ./protobuf-server2.sh

2. Open another console in pdns/zzz-gca-example and run ./dnsdist2-complex.sh

3. Open another console in pdns/zzz-gca-example and run ./dig-test-nocookie.sh

   This should produce output in the protobuf server console similar to this (notice that the word FWD appears):

[2017-07-12 17:24:00.414274] Response of size 55: 127.0.0.1 -> 127.0.0.1 (UDP), id: 56469, uuid: 134f672434b34f36bef01ad48b06ec7b

- Response Code: 0, RRs: 1, Tags: Trans, FWD
	 - 1, 1, google.com., 299, 172.217.7.174

4. From the same console used in step #3 run ./dig-test-nocookie.sh again

   This should produce output in the protobuf server console similar to this (notice that the word CACHE appears):

[2017-07-12 17:24:04.693645] Response of size 55: 127.0.0.1 -> 127.0.0.1 (UDP), id: 33312, uuid: 8aa92d90666d4007801c893cd2245a0b

	 - 1, 1, google.com., 295, 172.217.7.174

5. From the same console used in steps #3 anmd #4 and run ./dig-test-rpz.sh

   This should produce output in the protobuf server console similar to this (notice that the word RPZ appears):

[2017-07-12 17:24:26.907319] Response of size 56: 127.0.0.1 -> 127.0.0.1 (UDP), id: 48430, uuid: 59552d4fa7df4944ad1a949a0b970b54

Important files:

	build-dnsdist2.sh - script to build dnsdist with the libsodium option enabled - needed for protobuf operation.

	dig-test-rpz.sh - script to send a rpz request to dnsdist.

	dnsdist.conf - vanilla demonstration config file for dnsdist that does not use tinycdb for simple demonstration.

	dnsdist2-complex.conf - demonstration config file for dnsdist that uses tinycdb for accessing rpz database.

	./dnsdist-notes-7-12-2017.txt - this file
	
	./make-dnsdist2.sh - make file to recompile dnsdist without doing an entire build

	./protobuf-server2.sh - launch the generic protobuf server which is in pdns/contrib 

	./test-all.sh - script to call all regression tests for dnsdist.

	./test-protobuf.sh - script to call only the regression test for the protobuf module in dnsdist.

	./test-tinycdb.lua - lua code to test the operation of lua, tinycdb and the cdb database together.



Notes on dnsdist2-complex.conf

    The configuration file is a bit hard to follow, but it permits our goals to be accomplished with only adding a minimum of 
    internal lua callable dnsdist C++ code.  The critical rules are located together at the bottom of the config file.

    If this file is too cluttered you may want to look at the simpler dnsdist.conf example.  This configuration file does not
    use the cdb database and might be a little easier to study.

A brief description of dnsdist2-complex.conf:

    The top 74 lines load in the lua-tinycdb library, the demo blocklist file (~800,000 entries) and preform some simple tests
    to verify that the cdb library is working.

    Lines 80 thru 93 select the DNS servers to be used, currently only the google ones are enabled.

    Lines 95 thru 110 setup the "masterpool" pool cache.

    Line 116 allows dnsdist to listen to requests on port 5200, which allows for non-root testing on my machine.

    Lines 119, 120 and 121 are used to select the ip address and port to communicate with the protobuf server.

    Lines 124 thru 152 is a simple maintenance function, whose purpose is to display some stats once a minute on the dnsdist console.

    Lines 153 thru 222 are the luaCheckBL function, this code is called by the first rule which is on line 405.  This function
    checks the lua-tinycdb RPZ database to see if there is a match.  If there is a match the next rule is processed, which
    is on line 407 which causes the lua function luaLogBL to be called.  If there is no match in the RPZ database the 
    luaCheckBL function is returned with the pool action which allows normal processing to occur using the "masterpool'.  The 
    luaCheckBL function contains two non-native dnsdist lua callable functions dq:setTag() and dq:setTagArray().  The 
    purpose of these functions is to store the information from the RPZ (blacklist) hit until the luaLogBL function is called. 
    This will allow the additional infromation about the blacklist entry to be added to the protobuf output.

    Lines 227 to 325 are the luaLogBL function.  This function is called by the rule on line 407, which is arrived at by the luaCheckBL
    function passing on to the next rule which happens when there is a match in the RPZ (blacklist) database.  The function
    allows the addition of new information in the protobuf output.  It contains a few new dnsdist lua functions.
    dr:getTagArray() to read the table generated in the luaCheckBL function and pbMsg:setTagArray() to enter information in the 'tags'
    field of the protobuf message to be sent out.  pbMsg:setResponseCode(dnsdist.NXDOMAIN) which sets the protobuf response code to be
    NXDOMAIN. To set the protobuf message to be type 'response' instead of 'query' pbMsg:setProtobufResponseType() is called.  This 
    function can also set the query time in the protobuf message if desired with the optional parameters.  Lastly the function
    pbMsg:addResponseRR() is called to add a 'RR' to the protobuf message.

 
    Lines 330 thru 355 are the luaLogForward function.  This function is called by the rule on line 417 in response to a 'normal'
    ie. not a cache or rpz lookup.  This function allows the addition of new information in the protobuf output.  An example of
    this is the function call on line 345: pbMsg:setTag("Trans. FWD").  It's purpose is to label the protobuf message as resulting
    from a normal lookup in the 'tags' field.

    Lines 363 thru 380 are the luaLogCache function.  This function is called by the rule on line 414 in response to a 'cache' hit.
    This function allows the addition of new information in the protobuf output.  An example of
    this is the function call on line 345: pbMsg:setTag("Trans. CACHE").  It's purpose is to label the protobuf message as resulting
    from a normal lookup in the 'tags' field.

    Lines 386 to 394 are the luaRetNXDOMAIN function.  This function is called by the rule on line 409 which occurs after the 
    luaLogBL function is called by the previous rule when a RPZ (blacklist) hit occurs.  It's purpose is to return a NXDOMAIN message
    to the client which a RPZ (blacklist) hit has occurred.


A description of the new Lua commands for dnsdist:

    Lua additional functions that act on the DNSQuestion parameter dq.

    They are  expected to be used inside of a Lua function that is setup for use in the dnsdist configuration file by the addLuaAction function.   
    They are used to store text label and value pairs in the DNSQuestion dq and accessed by the DNSResponse Lua functions below.

	To store a text label and value pair in the DNSQuestion:

		dq:setTag(“LabelText”, “ValueText”) 

	To store values as a table in the DNSQuestion structure:

		dq:setTagArray(exampleTable)




    Lua additional functions that act on the DNSDistProtoBufMessage parameter pbMsg.

    These are expected to be located inside of a Lua function that is setup for use in the dnsdist configuration file by the RemoteLogAction function as 
    the “alterFunction”.  They are used to modify the protobuf message that is being sent to the protobuf server.

	To store text values in the protobuf  “tags” field:

		pbMsg:setTag(“ValueText”)

	To store text values  as a table in protobuf tag fields

		pbMsg:setTagArray(exampleTable)


	To change the protobuf message from a ‘query’ to a ‘response’.
        Optional query time parameters seconds and fractional micro-seconds may be passed too.

		pbMsg:setProtobufResponseType([seconds, micro-seconds])


	To add a 'RR' record to the protobuf type response message:
	strReqName is a string with the name the client requested.
	type is integer RR type, 1 is 'A'.
        class is the integer RR class, 1 is 'IN'
	ttl is RR 'time to live' and is an integer like 456.
	blobData is the data part of the RR.
             	An example for type 1, class 1 is:  blobData = '\127' .. '\000' .. '\000' .. '\001'

		pbMsg:addResponseRR(strReqName, type, class, ttl, blobData)
