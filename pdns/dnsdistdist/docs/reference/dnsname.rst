.. _DNSName:

DNSName objects
===============

A :class:`DNSName` object represents a name in the DNS. It has several functions that can manipulate it without conversions to strings.
Creating a ``DNSName`` is done with the :func:`newDNSName`::

  myname = newDNSName("www.example.com")

dnsdist will complain loudly if the name is invalid (e.g. too long, dot in the wrong place).

The ``myname`` variable has several functions to get information from it

.. code-block:: lua

  print(myname:countLabels()) -- prints "3"
  print(myname:wirelength()) -- prints "17"
  name2 = newDNSName("example.com")
  if myname:isPartOf(name2) then -- prints "it is"
    print('it is')
  end

  .. method:: DNSName:toDNSString() -> string

    Returns a wire format form of the DNSName, suitable for usage in :func:`SpoofRawAction`.

  .. method:: DNSName:toString() -> string
              DNSName:tostring() -> string
